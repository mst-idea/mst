# Model Specification Tree, the Idea

The idea of Model Specification Tree (MST) combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Specification Trees—using LLMs' ability to understand descriptions and generate outputs to automate steps in such systems engineering management methodology. This may reduce manual work in LLMs' workflow cycles and improves output quality.

## 0. Preface

Today, large language model (LLM) technology has advanced significantly. For over a century, systems engineering management methodologies (especially for design and R&D) have built up a lot of knowledge, even when limited by human labor resources in the past. But now, with the help of LLMs, many detailed management methods that were too costly for humans to use are becoming possible. These methods might be able to help LLMs to handle more complex tasks, give better feedback, and produce more consistent results -- letting humans focus on ideas and creativity, only stepping in when necessary.

This article is neither standard proposal nor any existing application implementations. It’s just an idea about combining LLMs and systems engineering, with many parts still working in progress, so don’t expect to find any answers you wish here. While the author is trying to validate the idea, this article is only about the idea itself. The author intends this concept to remain unconstrained by any software, product, or platform (even including the ones developed by the author himself), so that this article had been open-sourced for everyone to access once the author conceiving such idea.
