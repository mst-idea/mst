# Model Specification Tree, the Idea

The idea of **MST** (Model Specification Tree) was inspired by the combination of **LLM** (Large Language Model) tools and the methodology of **Specification Tree**. Specifically, it leverages the capability of LLMs to understand descriptions and generate various types of outputs, to implement as many intermediate steps as possible in the systems engineering management method known as Specification Tree, in order to minimize unnecessary repetitive manual operations during the workflow of LLMs and ensure more qualified outputs.
